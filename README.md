# Convex Hull

This algorithm was designed by me for an assignment during my Computational Geometry course at IIT Bhubaneswar. The problem given was to create a convex hull from a set of already given N convex hulls. 

As part of the assignment, I had to document the algorithm that I designed and also give its theoretical complexity. This can be found in Algorithm_and_Complexity.pdf.

- The inputs to the program are the coordinates of k convex hulls. The input is already hardcoded (5 convex hull objects).  

- The outputs are the coordinates of the final convex hull generated from these k convex hulls. 

<b>How to run the program?</b>

- Compile and run the file on a Linux terminal using: 

$ g++ -o convexhull 14CS01043_Assignment_1.cpp 

$ ./convexhull 

Note: The C++ compiler used should be Standard 11 or higher. 

Cheers.
